# Quipux Challenge

This project is built using modern web development tools, specifically focusing on Vue.js and Vite for building a fast, efficient, and modular front-end application. Below is an overview of the main tools and libraries used, along with instructions on how to run the project.

## Tools & Dependencies

### Main Dependencies

1. **[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)**:  
   Vue.js is the core framework used for building the user interface of this project. It's a progressive JavaScript framework used for building reactive and component-based web applications.

2. **[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)**:  
   Bootstrap 5 provides a responsive, mobile-first layout system with various CSS components that simplify web development. This project uses Bootstrap to style components and layouts.

3. **[Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)**:  
   Bootstrap Icons is a free, open-source icon library designed specifically for Bootstrap projects. It provides a wide range of icons, enhancing the user interface.

### Development Dependencies

1. **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**:  
   Vite is a next-generation front-end build tool designed for speed and simplicity. It provides a fast development server and efficient bundling for production builds.

2. **[@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue)**:  
   This plugin integrates Vue.js with Vite, enabling the framework's Single File Components (SFCs) to work seamlessly during development and production.

3. **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)**:  
   Sass is a CSS preprocessor that allows writing more efficient, modular, and maintainable CSS. It enables the use of features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, which makes it easier to manage complex stylesheets.

## Project Structure

- The project is set up as an ES module project (`"type": "module"`), which allows using modern JavaScript syntax like `import`/`export`.
- The application uses `Vue.js` components and `Sass` for styling.

## How to Get Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** Clone the repository and install dependencies with:
